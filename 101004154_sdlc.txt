Level 5 Gyatt Rizz Copypasta or Level 5 Gyatt Rizz Livvy Dunne Rizzing Up Baby Gronk 
is a slang overload copypasta consisting
 of a long string of Gen Z and Gen Alpha internet slang terms and references,
 meant to sound as absurd as possible. The copypasta was popularized on TikTok in September
 2023 when user @notmr.bigchops69 posted a viral video reciting it, inspiring TikTokers to use
 the original sound in memes and lip dubs and spread the sentence across social media as a copypasta.
